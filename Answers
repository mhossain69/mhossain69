Question 1:

Here's the correct answer for each prompt based on the image:

Mutable, Indexable, has a .split()
Correct Answer: String
Explanation: Strings in Python have a .split() method, making them the correct answer here. Lists are also mutable and indexable but lack the .split() method.

Cannot be a dictionary key
Correct Answer: List
Explanation: Lists are mutable and thus cannot serve as dictionary keys. Immutable types like strings, numbers, and tuples can be used as dictionary keys.

Cannot use .insert() or .add()
Correct Answer: Tuple
Explanation: Tuples are immutable and donâ€™t have .insert() or .add() methods. Lists, on the other hand, support .insert().

Non-indexed, Mutable
Correct Answer: Dictionary
Explanation: Dictionaries are mutable and non-indexed (though they use keys for access). Lists and tuples are indexed.
