Question 1:
Based on the terms and the descriptions provided, hereâ€™s the best possible matching:

    Append - "you can do it with lists but not sets."
    Definite Iteration - "when you loop for a known number of times."
    mutable - "changes the original variable."
    Iteration - "handle a group of things one at a time using a loop."
    Indefinite Iteration - "when you don't know how many times a loop will occur."
    Step Over - "one way of using a debugger, which does not enter into a Function."
    Modulo - "gives the remainder of an integer division."
    Immutable - "can't be modified after being created."
    Scope - "this explains why you can have two variables with the same name but different values."
    Break Point - "used to pause the execution of Python code inside the debugger."

This should cover all terms with the most fitting descriptions. Let me know if you need further clarification!
