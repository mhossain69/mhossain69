Question 1:
Based on the terms and the descriptions provided, hereâ€™s the best possible matching:

    Append - "you can do it with lists but not sets."
    Definite Iteration - "when you loop for a known number of times."
    mutable - "changes the original variable."
    Iteration - "handle a group of things one at a time using a loop."
    Indefinite Iteration - "when you don't know how many times a loop will occur."
    Step Over - "one way of using a debugger, which does not enter into a Function."
    Modulo - "gives the remainder of an integer division."
    Immutable - "can't be modified after being created."
    Scope - "this explains why you can have two variables with the same name but different values."
    Break Point - "used to pause the execution of Python code inside the debugger."

This should cover all terms with the most fitting descriptions. Let me know if you need further clarification!


Question 2:
The correct answer is:

B. set(l1 + l2)

Explanation:

    The desired output is a set containing unique elements from both lists l1 and l2.
    Using set(l1 + l2) combines the two lists, removes duplicates, and creates a set with the unique elements from both lists.

The other options don't achieve this:

    A (list(l1).append(l2)) appends l2 as a single item to the list, resulting in a nested list structure.
    C (set(set(l1) + l2)) is invalid syntax as you cannot add a set and a list directly.
    D (list(l2).intersection(l1)) would only give the intersection of the two lists, not the union.

Thus, B is the correct command.
