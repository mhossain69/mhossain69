This is Question 1
Based on the questions and the context from the image, here are the correct answers explained:

Mutable, Indexable, has a .split() method:

Correct answer: String. Strings are indexable and have a .split() method. Although they are immutable, they meet the criteria listed (this may be a tricky question).
Cannot be a dictionary key:

Correct answer: List. Lists are mutable, so they cannot be used as dictionary keys in Python, while immutable types like strings and tuples can be used as keys.
Cannot use .insert() or .add():

Correct answer: Tuple. Tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify them by inserting elements or adding new elements after creation.
Non-indexed, Mutable:

Correct answer: Dictionary. Dictionaries are mutable, but they are non-indexed in the traditional sense (they use key-value pairs, not numeric indexes).
Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these!
