Code is 356351

Got in

check code1.py and code2.py. lmk if that is fine

Forget quiz4.py He said it has to be in one file

so the class square needs to be in the same code as class rectangle?
Yea just one file
okay

if you put the class square code with the class rectangle than it will also give the output of class square. is that how he wants it? or just the output of class rectangle?

Both output in one file
